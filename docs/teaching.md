# Teaching

We previously taught a course in the FU Master's Program in Bioinformatics (CUB848)
on genomic algorithms (2014-2016). The course was part of 
[Institute of Bioinformatics at the Department of Computer Science and Mathematics of the Free Univerity of Berlin](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/bioinf/index.html)
The slides are provided here but this course is currently not being held. 
A German language course on Genetics was taught in the Bachelor's program (see below).
