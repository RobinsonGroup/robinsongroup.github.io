## The Robinson Lab

Our lab is made up of bioinformaticians, computer scientists, ontologists, curators, and software engineers.
Our mission is to develop software resources and algorithms to improve human health. Although our focus has been
on rare genetic disease, current projects involve common diseases and cancer. 

We welcome lab members of any nationality, sex, or gender, expect dedication and passion for bioinformatics, and provide training in 
academic research in bioinformatics including AI/ML, ontologies, algorithms, and software engineering. 

Lab meetings and presentations are typically conducted in English.
